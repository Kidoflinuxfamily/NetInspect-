  pip install pcapy

  ## • Installation in kali linux:

  To install and run the NetInspect tool on Kali Linux, you can follow these steps:

  First install pip:

  apt install python3-pip

  1. Clone the Repository: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the NetInspect tool code onto your Kali Linux system. Open a terminal and use the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Kidoflinuxfamily/NetInspect-.git

2. Navigate to the Repository: Use the cd command to move into the directory where you cloned the repository:

cd NetInspect

3. Install Dependencies: Before running the NetInspect tool, you need to ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed. In this case, the tool relies on the pcapy library. You can install it using pip:

   pip install pcapy 

   Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

   4. Run the Tool: Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the NetInspect tool using the following command:

   python netinspect.py

   5. Capture Network Traffic:
   NetInspect should now be capturing and analyzing network traffic on the specified interface. You'll see output displaying information about each packet captured.

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to capture network traffic on your system, typically requiring root or sudo privileges. Also, verify that the specified network interface (eth0 in this case) is correct and accessible on your system.

That's it! You've successfully installed and run the NetInspect tool on Kali Linux. 

## • Installation
